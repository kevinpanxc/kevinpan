The bike across the bridge was amazing. Next, we made our way to Sausilito downtown. Sausilito is beautiful. Why do they specifically have city staff to direct and help bikers? :o We had 4pm \"lunch\" at Lappert's. I got fish tacos (there was cilantro!). Took the ferry back to SF afterwards and biked to the AT&T park just to see the outside of the stadium as a game was about to begin. Biked to the Tacqueria Can-cun on 19th and Mission afterwards for dinner. Coincidentally saw Brian and his friends there for dinner. The line at the restaurant was sooo long, went into the corridor to the washrooms and wrapped around. Best burrito I've ever had in my life. It was a super burrito with marinated pork. Also tried Coke in a glass bottle, pretty good. Biked to Adrian's place and hung out before the next caltrain. We stayed a bit too long and had to rush to catch it but the train, which was supposed to leave at 9:30 left at 10:15 for some reason -.- We had our bikes locked up on the train and missed the California Avenue caltrain stop since unlocking took too long (learned that we shouldn't lock our bikes on the train).
